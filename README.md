Completed: 04.11.24 <br />
Project Description: Write a function [intGames] that takes a positive integer n and outputs the Collatz sequence starting with n and ending with 1. <br />
Additional idea[intGamesAi]: Replace the sequence by a binary sequence as follows: If the number goes up, place a 1, and if the number goes down, place a 0.
